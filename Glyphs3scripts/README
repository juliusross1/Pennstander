To build the fonts: run createmasters.py script on PennstanderMath.glyphs Glyphs 3 and then export from Glyphs3.

Notes:

1. PennstanderMath is a variable font, but since the mathematics table does not recognize this we instead use instances.  

2. The script creates a new font with an additional axes that is used for the Bold and Italics mathematics letters.

3. The bold-math and boliditalic-math letters in PennstanderMath are written over by the script (using the upright and italics version of the letters), and thus editing them within PennstanderMath.glyphs has no effect.

4. The exports for PennstanderText have the italics axes at 50/100 which is different from the instances used in Grandstander.
