To build the fonts: run createmasters.py script on PennstanderMath.glyphs Glyphs 3 and then export from Glyphs3.

About: PennstanderMath is a variable font, but since the mathematics table does not recognize this we instead use instances.  The script creates a new font with an additional axes that is used for the Bold mathematics letters.
Note also that the exports for PennstanderText have the italics axes at 50/100 which is different from the instances used in Grandstander.
